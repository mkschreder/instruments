- [Training](https://swedishembedded.com/tag/training): get training.
- [Swedish Embedded Platform SDK](https://github.com/swedishembedded/sdk): get the platform SDK.

## What are instruments?

This project is about creating standalone instruments that can be used together
with Swedish Embedded Platform SDK to enable easy prototyping, simulation and
measurement of signals from embedded systems.

Instruments can be used with Renode by simply mapping them into the address
space of the simulated firmware!
